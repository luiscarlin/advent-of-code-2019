position of each moon
simulate motion of each moon

position = (x, y, z)
velocity = (dx, dy, dz)
velocity for each moon starts at 0

simulate in time steps

start of time step #1
  - update velocity by applying gravity for all moons
  - update position of every moon using their velocity
end of time step #1

gravity: 
- grab a pair of moons
- for each (x, y, z) axis
  - velocity for each moon changes by +1 or -1
  - if Moon1 position x = 5 and Moon2 position x = 1 => Moon1 velocity x+=1 and Moon2 velocity x-=1
    - if same, then no changes

potential energy = sum of absolute values of positions x, y , z
kinetic energy = sum of absolute values of velocities x, y , z
total energy = potential + kinetic

find total energy in system after 1000 steps
