when printing: 
- # for walls
- D for droid
- ' ' for unkown
- . for known

inputs = {
  north = 1
  south = 2
  west = 3
  east = 4
}

output = {
  0 = droid hit a wall (position has not changed)
  1 = moved one step in the requested direction
  2 = moved one step in the requested direction and oxigen system found
}

loop:
- run intcode with movement command as input
- robot moves
- read status from output

goal: find fewest number of steps from start position to oxygen system position
